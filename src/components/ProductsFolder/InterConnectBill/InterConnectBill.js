            As operators move deeper into next-generation services and
            content-driven service environments, revenue assurance becomes both
            more complex and more critical. Product portfolios are expanding,
            networks, services, operations and revenue chains are becoming
            increasingly complicated. Due to their growth, operators have to
            deal with large volumes of data, control points, KPIs involving time
            consuming and repetitive investigations. In today’s dynamic
            communications environment, a successful revenue assurance practice
            requires a highly mature revenue assurance solution – one that not
            only enables proactive and ongoing revenue recovery but simplifies
            RA by visually aiding telecom operators and guiding them to improve
            performance.

            The wholesale market today is increasingly aggressive and
            deregulated. Competition is fierce, margins are threatened, billions
            of different types of events require rating and analysis, agreements
            are complex and quality of service requires constant vigilance. In
            such an environment, operators need a partner settlement solution
            which efficiently accommodates new service launches with their
            tariff plans and complex revenue-share agreements. The solution,
            apart from simply billing and rating accurately, also needs to
            provide advanced and detailed information about the entire wholesale
            business for voice as well as content; thereby helping service
            providers make informed decisions.

            settle charges with their network and content partners. It helps
            operators improve efficiency through light touch and automation,
            accurate billing and settlement and prudent accrual provisioning.
            Catering to the need for visibility of each deal's impact on an
            operator's bottom line owing to shrinking margins, the solution
            provides strong coverage in all areas from order to cash. It enables
            operators to manage costs and revenues on interconnect and partner
            agreements with domestic and international operators as well as

            of complex agreements in areas such as IP and content-based services
            require new system capabilities to ensure that operators have
            accurate data available to assure revenues.
